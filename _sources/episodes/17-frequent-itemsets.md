# Frequent Itemsets


## 1. The market-basket model

- Describe a common form of many-to-many relationship between two kinds of objects. 
  - A large set of `items`. e.g.: things sold in a supermarket. 
  - A large set of `baskets`, each of which is a small set of items. e.g.: things one
  customer buys on one trip to the supermarket. 
     - Number of `baskets` cannot fit into memory. 




## 2. Definition of a frequent itemsets.

- A set of items that appears in many baskets is said to be `frequent`. 
- Assume a value `s`: *support threshold*. 
- If `I` is a set of items. 
  - The `support` for `I` is the number of baskets in which `I` is a subset. 
- `I` is frequent if its support is `s` or higher. 




## 3. Example: frequent itemsets

- items = {milk, coke, pepsi, beer, juice}
  - B1: m,c,b
  - B2: m,p,j
  - B3: m,b
  - B4: c,j
  - B5: m,p,b
  - B6: m,c,b,j
  - B7: c,b,j
  - B8: b,c
- Support value `s` = 3 (three baskets)
- Frequent itemsets:
  - {m}, {c}, {b}, {j}, {m,b}, {b,c}, {c,j}




## 4. Applications

- Items: products; Baskets: sets of products. 
  - Given that many people buy beer and diapers together: run a sale on diapers 
  and raise price of beer. 
  - Given that many people buy hotdog and mustards together: run a sale of hotdog 
  and raise price of mustards. 
- Items = documents; baskets = sentences/phrases.
  - Items that appear together too often could represent plagiarism. 
- Items = words, basket = documents.
  - Unusual words appearing together in large number of documents indicating 
  interesting relationship. 



## 5. Scale of the problem

- Walmart sells hundreds of thousands of items, and has billions of transactions 
(shopping basket/cart at checkout). 
- The Web has billions of words and many billions of pages. 




## 6. Association Rules:

- `If-then` rules abou the contents of baskets. 
- `{i_1, i_2, ..., i_k} -> j` means: "If a basket contains all of i_1,...,i_k then it is 
`likely` to contain j."
- `Confidence` of this association rule is the probability of j given {i_1,...,i_k}.
  - The fraction of the basket with {i_1,...,i_k} that also contain j. 
- Example:
  - B1: m,c,b
  - B2: m,p,j
  - B3: m,b
  - B4: c,j
  - B5: m,p,b
  - B6: m,c,b,j
  - B7: c,b,j
  - B8: b,c
- An association rule: {m,b} -> c
  - Basket contains m and b: B1, B3, B5, B6
  - Basket contains m, b, and c: B1, B6
  - C = 2 / 4 = 50%



## 7. Finding association rules

- **Find all association rules with support >= s and confidence >=c**
- Hard part: funding the frequent itemsets. 




## 8. Computation model

- Data is stored in flat files on disk. 
- Most likely basket-by-basket. 
- Expand baskets into pairs, triples, etc as you read the baskets. 
  - Use `k` nested loops to generate all sets of size `k`.  
- I/O cost: per passes (all baskets read). 




## 9. Main-memory bottleneck

- For many frequent-itemset algorithms, main memory is the critical resource. 
- We need to keep count of things (occurrences of pairs/triples/...) when we read baskets.
- The number of different things we can count is limited by main memory. 
- Swapping counts is going to be horrible. 




## 10. Naive algorithm

- Hardest problem is finding `frequent pairs` because they are the most common. 
- Read file once, counting in main memory the occurences of each pair. 
- For each basket of `n` items, there will be `n(n-1)/2` pairs, generated by 
double-nested loops. 
- If `n^2` exceeds main memory, we fails. 



## 11. Naive algorithm: how do we count. 

- Count all pairs using a triangular matrix. 
  - Requires 4 bytes per pair for all possible pairs: 2n^2
- Keep a table ot triples [i, j, c] with c is the count of pair {i,j}.
  - Requires 12 bytes only for pairs with count > 0: 12p with p is the number 
  of pairs that actually occur. 




## 12. A-Priori algorithm. 

- Limit the need for main memory.
- Key idea: `monotonicity`
  - If a set of items appears at least `s` times, so does every subset of this set. 
- Contrapositive: If an item `i` does not appear in `s` baskets, then no pair 
containing `i` can appear in s baskets. 
- A-Priori algorithm:
  - Pass 1: read baskets and count the item occurrences. Only keep items that appear 
  at least `s` times - `frequent items`. 
  - Pass 2: read baskets again and only count in main memory only those pairs whose 
  both items were found to be frequent from Pass 1. 
  - Repeat the process with increasing number of items added to only sets found to be
  `frequent`.

  - C1 = all items
  - In general, L_k are members of C_k with support greater than or equal to `s`. 
  - C_(k+1) includes (k+1) sets, each k of which is in L_k. 



## 13. A-Priori at scale

- Under two passes.
- SON: Savasere-Omiecinski-Navathe
- Adaptable to a distributed data model (mapreduce). 
  - Repeatedly read small subsets of the baskets into main memory 
  and perform `a-priori` on these subsets, using a support that is
  equal to the main support divided by the total numbers of subsets. 
  - Aggregate all candidate itemsets and determine which are frequent 
  in the entire set.
