# Working with GitHub

Knowing version control systems is a critical skill for computer 
scientists. There are several version control systems, and 
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is one of the most, if not the most, 
popular one. 

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version 
control and collaboration using Git. It is highly recommended that each 
of you create and maintain your own GitHub account.
