## Course Description

This course will investigate issues in modern distributed platforms by examining a number of important 
technologies in the areas of distributed computing in computational and data-intensive problems. By the end 
of the course, each student should understand and be able to apply several specific tradeoffs for 
parallel application and algorithms development, performance, and management on a number of 
distributed platforms.


## Learning Objectives

At the completion of the course, students should be able to
- Apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer 
science theory in the modeling and design of computer-based systems in a 
way that demonstrates comprehension of the tradeoffs involved in design choices.
- Analyze a problem and identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.
- Apply design and development principles in the construction of large-scale computing systems.
- Function effectively on teams to accomplish a common goal.


## Prerequisites

- Working knowledge of C/C++, Python, and Linux system. Working knowledge of data 
structures and algorithms.  


## Course Materials

- Lecture slides and videos will be available on canvas.
- Example codes will be available in slides and on Palmetto 
- Links to papers on subjects we will be discussing in class 
will also be listed and/or embedded in the slides.


## Laptop Requirements

- Having access to a laptop during class time is critical
- Working with supercomputing resources in class
- Working on in-class electronic quizzes on Canvas

```{dropdown} Lateness Policy:
Assignments that are late are assessed a 10% per day late penalty.
Saturday and Sunday are each days.
```


## General Policy

```{dropdown} Attendance
Attendance is critical to the success of students in the class. Substantial 
project information will be provided in class lectures. Random quizzes or roll 
calls will be made in class. No individual lectures will be given. 
```


```{dropdown} Late-work 
An assignment submitted within 0 to 24 hours after the due time will only be eligible 
for 80% of the maximum number of points allotted; An assignment submitted within 24 
to 48 hours after the due time will only be eligible for 50% of the maximum number of 
points allotted; Assignments submitted more than 48 hours after the due time will not 
be accepted. 
```

```{dropdown} Re-grade 
All requests for re-grades must be submitted within one week of the graded assignments 
being returned. Mistakes occasionally happen during the grading process. If you think a 
mistake has been made regarding your grades, you should send me an email with detailed 
justification within one week of the date the grades are available. No changes on grades 
will be made after one week from the date the grades are posted.
```

```{dropdown} Academic Integrity
**As members of the Clemson University community, we have inherited Thomas Green Clemsonâ€™s 
vision of this institution as a high seminary of learning.** Fundamental to this vision is a 
mutual commitment to truthfulness, honor, and responsibility, without which we cannot earn 
the trust and respect of others. Furthermore, we recognize that academic dishonesty detracts 
from the value of a Clemson degree. Therefore, we shall not tolerate lying, cheating, or 
stealing in any form.
```


```{dropdown} Collaboration Policy
Collaboration between students on homework assignments in this class is permitted. 
Plagiarism is not allowed. Taking assignments from other classmates or downloading 
completed assignments from websites is not allowed. 
```

```{dropdown} Disability Accommodations 
If you have a documented disability that requires an accommodation, please contact me 
so we can set up an appointment to discuss your needs. Or contact: Student Disability 
Services, G20 Redfern, 864-656-6848.
```

```{dropdown} Mobile Devices
