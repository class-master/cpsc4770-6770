# The demand for computational speed"

## How do we measure speed in computation?

```{dropdown}
- Floating-Point Operation per Second (FLOPS)
  - Count number of floating-point calculations (arithmetic operations) per second.
- Not MIPS (millions of instructions per second) as MIPS also count non-arithmetic
operations such as data movement or condition.  
$$FLOPS = sockets \times \frac{cores}{socket} \times \frac{cycles}{second} \times \frac{FLOPS}{cycle}$$  
- MFLOPS (megaFLOPS) = 1,000,000 FLOPS
- GGLOPS (gigaFLOPS) = 1,000,000,000 FLOPS

```

## Modern measurement of speed
```{dropdown}
- TFLOPS (teraFLOPS) = 1,000,000,000,000 FLOPS
  - Intel's ASCI Red for Sandia National Laboratory (DOE) was the first supercomputer in the world 
  to achieve 1 TFLOPS in 1997. 
  - ASCI Red is used for large-scale simulation in nuclear weapon development and material analysis. 
- PFLOPS (petaFLOPS) = 1,000,000,000,000,000 FLOPS
  - IBM RoadRunner for Los Alamos National Laboratory (DOE) was the first supercomputer to achieve 
  1 PFLOPS in 2008. 
  - Oak Ridge National Laboratoryâ€™s Summit (DOE) is the second fastest supercomputer in the world at 
  148.6 PFLOPS.
  - Fugaku of RIKEN Center for Computational Science (Japan) is the current fastest supercomputer at 
  415 PFLOPS. 
- EFLOPS (exaFLOPS)  = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 FLOPS
  - Aurora (> 1 EFLOPS, 2021, Argonne National Lab)
  - Frontier (> 1.5 EFLOPS, 2021, Oak Ridge National Lab)
  - El Capitan (> 2 FFLOPS, 2023, Lawrence Livermore National Lab)
  - Tianhe 3 (first China Exascale computer, 2020, National University of Defense Technology)
  - Subsequent update to Fugaku (first Japan Exascale computer, 2021, RIKEN Center for Computational Science)
  - Europe, India, Taiwan on track

```

## The bragging list (The TOP500 Project)
```{dropdown}
- List the 500 most powerful computers in the world.
- Count FLOPS by having supercomputer runs well-known computationally intensive tasks
  - Solve Ax=b, dense random matrix problem. 
  - Primarily dense matrix-matrix multiplications. 
- Updated twice a year:
  - International Supercomputing conference (June, Germany)
  - Supercomputing conference (November, US). 
- Website: http://www.top500.org

```

## Why do we need this much speed?
```{dropdown}
- The four modern paradigms of science
  - Theory
  - Experiment
  - Simulation
  - Data analysis
- Simulation: study things that are too big, too small, too fast, too slow, too expensive, or too dangerous. 
- Data anlaysis: study data that are too big, too complex, too fast (streaming data), too noisy.

## Hurricane Sandy (2012)
 - the deadliest and most destructive, as well as the strongest hurricane of the 2012 Atlantic hurricane season, 
 - the second-costliest hurricane on record in the United States (nearly $70 billion in damage in 2012),
 - affected 24 states, with particularly severe damage in New Jersey and New York,
 - hit New York City on October 29, flooding streets, tunnels and subway lines and cutting power in and around the city.
