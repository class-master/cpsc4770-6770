# MPI: pleasantly parallel and workload allocation

## 1. Definition
```{dropdown}
- Embarrassingly/naturally/pleasantly parallel. 
- A computation that can obviously be divided into a 
number of completely different parts, each of which can be 
executed by a separate process. 
- Each process can do its tasks without any interaction with 
the other processes, therefore, ...
  - No communication or very little communication among the processes.
```


## 2. Example: integral estimation using the trapezoid method
```{dropdown}
- A technique to approximate the integral of a function `f`.  
- Integral is defined as the area of the region bounded by the graph
`f`, the x-axis, and two vertical lines `x=a` and `x=b`. 
- We can estimate this area by dividing it into infinitesimal trapezoids.

## 3. Example: integral estimation using the trapezoid method
```{dropdown}
- Divide the area under the curve into 8 trapezoids with equal base `h`. 
  - `N` = 8
  - `a` = 0
  - `b` = 2
- The base `h` can be calculated as: 
  - `h` = (`b` - `a`) / `N` = 0.25

## 4. Example: integral estimation using the trapezoid method
```{dropdown}
- Which trapezoid (workload/task) goes to which process?
  - Start with small number of processes.
  - Calculation workload assignment manually for each count of processes.
  - Generalize assignment for process i based on sample calculations.

## 5. Example: integral estimation using the trapezoid method
```{dropdown}
- 4 processes: `P0`, `P1`, `P2`, `P3`: `size` = 4
- `N` = 8
- `a` = 0
- `b` = 2
- The height `h` can be calculated as: 
  - `h` = (`b` - `a`) / `N` = 0.25
- The amount of trapezoid per process: 
  - `local_n` = `N` / `size` = 2;
- `local_a`: variable represent the starting point of the local interval
for each process. Variable `local_a` will change as processes finish 
calculating one trapezoid and moving to another. 
  - `local_a` for `P0`= 0 = 0 + 0 * 2 * 0.25
  - `local_a` for `P1`= 0.5 = 0 + 1 * 2 * 0.25
  - `local_a` for `P2`= 1 = 0 + 2 * 2 * 0.25
  - `local_a` for `P2`= 1.5 = 0 + 3 * 2 * 0.25

## 6. Handson: integral estimation using the trapezoid method
```{dropdown}
- Your account (login/password) will work on both `taz` and `submitty`. 
- `USERNAME` represents the login name that you received in email.
- To access `taz` from a terminal:

~~~
$ ssh USERNAME@taz.cs.wcupa.edu
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- To access `submitty` from a terminal: 

~~~
$ ssh USERNAME@submitty.cs.wcupa.edu
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- The environments on `taz` and `submitty` are similar to one another. 
In the remainder of these lectures, example screenshots will be taken 
from `submitty`, but all commands will work on `taz` as well. 

- Change into `intro-mpi`

~~~
$ cd intro-mpi
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- To create a file from terminal, run `nano -c file_name`. 
- When finish editing, press `Ctrl-X` to select `Quit and Save`. 
- Press `Y` to confirm that you want to save. 
- Press `Enter` to confirm that you are saving to `file_name`. 
- Inside `intro-mpi`, create a file named `trapezoid.c` with the following
contents

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=trapezoid.c"></script>

- Compile and run `trapezoid.c`:

~~~
$ mpicc -o trapezoid trapezoid.c
$ mpirun -np 4 ./trapezoid 0 1 10
$ mpirun -np 4 ./trapezoid 0 1 100
$ mpirun -np 4 ./trapezoid 0 1 1000
$ mpirun -np 4 ./trapezoid 0 1 10000
~~~

## 7. Hands-on: static workload assignment
```{dropdown}
- Is this fair?
- Create a copy of `trapezoid.c` called `trapezoid_static.c` and modify `trapezoid_static.c`
to have the following contents

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=trapezoid_static.c"></script>

- Compile and run `trapezoid_static.c`:

~~~
$ mpicc -o trapezoid_static trapezoid_static.c
$ mpirun -np 4 ./trapezoid_static 0 1 1000
~~~
{: .language-bash}

<img src="../assets/figure/10-pleasantly/05.png" alt="trapezoid static" style="height:200px">

- This is called `static workload assignment`.

## 8. Hands-on: cyclic workload assignment
```{dropdown}
- Create a copy of `trapezoid_static.c` called `trapezoid_cyclic.c` and modify `trapezoid_cyclic.c` 
to have the following contents

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=trapezoid_cyclic.c"></script>

- Compile and run `trapezoid_cyclic.c`:

~~~

## 9. Hands-on: dynamic workload assignment
```{dropdown}
- Create a file called `trapezoid_dynamic_.c` with the following contents:
