# Representing and manipulating information

**Read chapter 2 of textbook.**

## 1. Everything is bits   
~~~{dropdown}  
 
- Each bit is `0` or `1`
- By encoding/interpreting sets of bits in various ways
  - Computers determine what to do (instructions)
  - … and represent and manipulate numbers, sets, strings, etc…
- Why bits?  Electronic Implementation
  - Easy to store with bistable elements.
  - Reliably transmitted on noisy and inaccurate wires.

## 2. Encoding byte values
~~~{dropdown}  

- Byte = 8 bits
- Binary: `0000 0000` to `1111 1111`. 
- Decimal: `0` to `255`. 
- Hexadecimal: `00` to `FF`. 
  - Base 16 number representation
  - Use character `0` to `9` and `A` to `F`. 
- Example: 15213 (decimal) = 0011 1011 0110 1101 (binary) = 3B6D (hex)

| Hex | Decimal | Binary |
| --- | ------- | ------ |
|  0  |    0    |  0000  |
|  1  |    1    |  0001  |
|  2  |    2    |  0010  |
|  3  |    3    |  0011  |
|  4  |    4    |  0100  |
|  5  |    5    |  0101  |
|  6  |    6    |  0110  |
|  7  |    7    |  0111  |
|  8  |    8    |  1000  |
|  9  |    9    |  1001  |
|  A  |   10    |  1010  |

## 4. Boolean algebra
~~~{dropdown}  

- Developed by George Boole in 19th century
- Algebraic representation of logic: encode `True` as `1` and `False` as `0`. 
- Operations: `AND` (`&`), `OR` (`|`), `XOR` (`^`), `NOT` (`~`).

| A | B | A&B  | A\|B  | A^B | ~A |
| - | - | ---- | ---- | --- | -- | 
| 0 | 0 | 0    | 0    | 0   | 1  |

~~~{dropdown}   

- Boolean operations: `&`, `|`, `^`, `~`.
- Shift operations:
  - Left Shift: 	x << y
    - Shift bit-vector x left y positions
    - Throw away extra bits on left
    - Fill with 0’s on right
  - Right Shift: 	x >y
    - Shift bit-vector x right y positions
    - Throw away extra bits on right
    - Logical shift (for unsigned values)
      - Fill with 0’s on left
    - Arithmetic shift (for signed values)
      - Replicate most significant bit on left
  - Undefined Behavior
    - Shift amount < 0 or ≥ word size
- Apply to any "integral" data type: long, int, short, char, unsigned
- View arguments as bit vectors. 
- Arguments applied bit-wise. 

~~~


## 7. Hands-on: bit-level operations in C
~~~{dropdown}   

- Inside your `csc231`, create another directory called `03-data` and change 
into this directory.
- Create a file named `bitwise_demo.c` with the following contents:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=bitwise_demo.c"></script>

- Compile and run `bitwise_demo.c`.
- Confirm that the binary printouts match the corresponding decimal printouts and the expected bitwise
operations.

- C does not mandate using 2's complement. 
  - But, most machines do, and we will assume so. 

|             | Decimal | Hex   | Binary            |
| ----------- | ------- | ----- | ----------------- | 
| short int x | 15213   | 3B 6D | 00111011 01101101 |  
| short int y | -15213  | C4 93 | 11000100 10010011 | 

- Sign bit
  - For 2's complement, most significant bit indicates sign.   
  - 0 for nonnegative
  - 1 for negative

~~~

## 9. 2's complement examples
~~~{dropdown}

- **2's complement representation depends on the number of bits.**
- Technical trick: A binary representation of the absolute value of 
negative 2 to the power of the number of bits minus the absolute value of the
negative number. 
- Simple example for 5-bit representation

|     | -16 | 8  | 4  | 2 | 1 |                   |
| --  | --- | -- | -- | - | - | ----------------- |  
| 10  | 0   | 1  | 0  | 1 | 0 | 8 + 2 = 10        |  
| -10 | 1   | 0  | 1  | 1 | 0 | -16 + 4 + 2 = -10 |

- Simple example for 6-bit representation

|     | -32 | 16 | 8  | 4 | 2 | 1 |                        |
| --  | --- | -- | -- | - | - | - |----------------------- |  
| 10  | 0   | 0  | 1  | 0 | 1 | 0 | 8 + 2 = 10             |  
| -10 | 1   | 1  | 0  | 1 | 1 | 0 | -32 + 16 + 4 + 2 = -10 |

## 10. Numeric ranges
~~~{dropdown}

- Unsigned values for `w-bit` word
  - UMin = 0
  - UMax = 2<sup>w</sup- 1
- 2's complement values for `w-bit` word
  - TMin = -2<sup>w-1</sup>
  - TMax = 2<sup>w-1</sup- 1
  - -1: 111..1

- Values for different word sizes:

|      | 8 (1 byte)    | 16 (2 bytes)      | 32 (4 bytes)             | 64 (8 bytes)                         |
| ---- | ---- | ------- | -------------- | -------------------------- |
| UMax | 255  | 65,535  | 4,294,967,295  | 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 |
| TMax | 127  | 32,767  | 2,147,483,647  | 9,223,372,036,854,775,807  |
| TMin | -128 | -32,768 | -2,147,483,648 | -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 | 

- Observations
  - abs(TMin) = TMax + 1
    - Asymetric range
  - UMax = 2 * TMax + 1

 - C programming
   - `#include <limits.h>`
   - Declares constants: `ULONG_MAX`, `LONG_MAX`, `LONG_MIN`
   - Platform specific

~~~

## 11. Challenge
~~~{dropdown}

- Write a C program called `numeric_ranges.c` that prints out the 
value of `ULONG_MAX`, `LONG_MAX`, `LONG_MIN`. Also answer the following 
question: If we multiply `LONG_MIN` by -1, what do we get?
- Note: You need to search for the correct format string specifiers.

## 12. Conversions (casting)
~~~{dropdown}

- C allows casting between different numeric data types. 
- What should be the effect/impact?
- Notations:
  - B2T: Binary to 2's complement
  - B2U: Binary to unsigned 
  - U2B: Unsigned to binary
  - U2T: Unsigned to 2's complement
  - T2B: 2's complement to binary
  - T2U: 2's complement to unsigned

 - U2T<sub>w</sub>(x) = x - 2<sup>w</supif x TMax<sub>w</sub>
 - U2T<sub>w</sub>(x) = x if x <= TMax<sub>w</sub>

- Summary
  - Bit pattern is maintained but reinterpreted
  - Can have unexpected effects: adding or subtracting 2<sup>w</sup>
  - When expressions contain both signed and unsigned int values, int values will be casted to unsigned. 

~~~

## 14. Hands on: casting
~~~{dropdown}

- Make sure that you are inside `03-data` directory.
- Create a file named `casting.c` with the following contents:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=casting.c"></script>

- Compile and run `casting.c`.
- Confirm that converted values are correct based on equations from slide 13. 

~~~
## 15. Challenge
~~~{dropdown}

- What is wrong with the following program? 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=for_loop.c"></script>
- How can this program be corrected?

:::{dropdown} Solution

- Truncating (e.g., unsigned to unsigned short)
  - Unsigned/signed: bits are truncated
  - Result reinterpreted
  - Unsigned: mod operation
  - Signed: similar to mod

- [Thule Site J](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thule_Site_J): USAF radar station for
missile warning and spacecraft tracking. 
- "There are many examples of errors arising from incorrect or incomplete specifications. 
One such example is a false alert in the early days of the nuclear age, when on 
October 5, 1960, the warning system at NORAD indicated that the United States was 
under massive attack by Soviet missiles with a certainty of 99.9 percent. It turned 
out that the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) radar in Thule, 
Greenland, had spotted the rising moon. Nobody had thought about the moon when specifying 
how the system should act." (Computer System Reliability and Nuclear War, CACM 1987).
- Moon's large size: 1000s of objects reported. 
- Moon's distance: .25 million miles
  - Thule's BMEWS max distance: 3000 miles. 
  - Truncated distance to the moon: `% sizeof(distance)` = 2200 miles. 
- Remember assignment 1: The computer does not "see", it only interprets.
  - **Thousands of objects on the sky within missile detection range!**. 
- Human control:
  - Kruschev was in New York on October 5, 1960. 
  - Someone at Thule said, "why not go check outside?"

## 18. Unsigned addition
~~~{dropdown}

- Given `w` bits operands
 - True sum can have `w + 1` bits (carry bit). 
 - Carry bit is discarded. 
- Implementation:
 - s = (u + v) mod 2<sup>w</sup>

~~~

## 19. Hands on: unsigned addition
~~~{dropdown}

- Make sure that you are inside `03-data` directory.
- Create a file named `unsigned_addition.c` with the following contents:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=unsigned_addition.c"></script>

- Compile and run `unsigned_addition.c`.
- Confirm that calculated values are correct. 

~~~

## 20. 2's complement addition
~~~{dropdown}

- Almost similar bit-level behavior as unsigned addition
  - True sum of `w`-bit operands will have `w+1`-bit, but
  - Carry bit is discarded. 
  - Remainding bits are treated as 2's complement integers. 
-  Overflow behavior is different
  - TAdd<sub>w</sub>(u, v) = u + v + 2<sup>w</supif u + v < TMin<sub>w</sub(**Negative Overflow**)
  - TAdd<sub>w</sub>(u, v) = u + v if TMin<sub>w</sub<= u + v <= TMax<sub>w</sub>
  - TAdd<sub>w</sub>(u, v) = u + v - 2<sup>w</supif u + v TMax<sub>w</sub(**Positive Overflow**)

~~~

## 21. Hands on: signed addition
~~~{dropdown}

- Make sure that you are inside `03-data` directory.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/d1e9336a82632c528ea797210ed0f553.js?file=signed_addition.c"></script>

- Compile and run `signed_addition.c`.
- Confirm that calculated values are correct. 

~~~

## 22. Multiplication
~~~{dropdown}

- Compute product of `w`-bit numbers x and y. 
- Exact results can be bigger than `w` bits. 
  - Unsigned: up to `2w` bits: 0 <= x * y <= (2<sup>w</sup- 1)<sup>2</sup>
  - 2's complement (negative): up to `2w - 1` bits: x * y >= (-2)<sup>2w-2</sup+ 2<sup>2w-1</sup>
  - 2's complement (positive): up to `2w` bits: x * y <= 2<sup>2w-2</sup>
- To maintain exact results:
  - Need to keep expanding word size with each product computed. 
  - Is done by software if needed ([arbitrary precision arithmetic packages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_arbitrary-precision_arithmetic_software)).
- **Trust your compiler**: Modern CPUs and OSes will most likely know to select the optimal method
to multiply. 

~~~

## 23. Multiplication and Division by power-of-2
~~~{dropdown}

- Power-of-2 multiply with shift
  - `u >k` gives u * 2<sup>k</sup>
  - True product has `w + k` bits: discard `k` bits. 
- Unsigned power-of-2 divide with shift
  - `u >k` gives floor(u / 2<sup>k</sup>)
  - Use logical shift.
- Signed power-of-2 divide with shift
  - x 0: `x >k` gives floor(u / 2<sup>k</sup>)
  - x < 0: `(x + (1 << k) - 1) >k` gives ceiling(u / 2<sup>k</sup>)
  - C statement: `(x < 0 ? x + (1 << k) - 1: x) >k`

## 24. Negation: complement and increase
~~~{dropdown}

- Negate through complement and increment:
  - `~x + 1 == -x`

~~~

## 25. Challenge
~~~{dropdown}
- Implement a C program called `negation.c` that implements and validates
the equation in slide 24. The program should take in a command line argument
that takes in a number of type `short` to be negated. 
- What happens if you try to negate `-32768`?

## 26. Byte-oriented memory organization
~~~{dropdown}

- Programs refer to data by address
  - Conceptually, envision it as a very large array of bytes
    - In reality, it’s not, but can think of it that way
  - An address is like an index into that array
    - and, a pointer variable stores an address
- Note: system provides private address spaces to each "process"
  - Think of a process as a program being executed
  - So, a program can clobber its own data, but not that of others

~~~

## 27. Machine words
~~~{dropdown}

- Any given computer has a "Word Size"
- `word size": Nominal size of integer-valued data and of addresses
- Until recently, most machines used 32 bits (4 bytes) as word size
  - Limits addresses to 4GB (232 bytes)
- Increasingly, machines have 64-bit word size
  - Potentially, could have 18 EB (exabytes) of addressable memory
  - That’s 18.4 X 1018
- Machines still support multiple data formats
  - Fractions or multiples of word size
  - Always integral number of bytes

~~~

## 28. Word-oriented memory organization
~~~{dropdown}

- Addresses specific byte locations
  - Address of first byte in word.
  - Address of successive words differ by 4 (32-bit) or 8 (64-bit).

## 30. Byte ordering in memory
~~~{dropdown}

- Machine-dependent
- Big Endian:  Sun (Oracle SPARC), PPC Mac, Internet (network data transfer)
  - Least significant byte has the highest address.
- Little Endian: x86, ARM processors running Android, iOS, and Linux
  - Least significant byte has lowest address.
- Example
  - Variable x has 4-byte value of 0x01234567
  - Address given by `&x` is 0x100

## 33. IEEE Foating point
~~~{dropdown}

- [IEEE Standard 754](https://standards.ieee.org/standard/754-2019.html)
  - Established in 185 as uniform standard for floating point arithmetic
  - Supported by all major CPUs
  - Some CPUs don’t implement IEEE 754 in full, for example, early GPUs, Cell BE processor
- Driven by numerical concerns
  - Nice standards for rounding, overflow, underflow
  - Hard to make fast in hardware (Numerical analysts predominated over hardware 
designers in defining standard).

## 34. Importance of floating-point arithmetic accuracy
~~~{dropdown}

- Ariane 5 explordes on maiden voyage: $500 million dollars lost. 
  - [64-bit floating point number assigned to 16-bit integer](http://sunnyday.mit.edu/nasa-class/Ariane5-report.html)
  - Cause rocket to get incorrect value of horizontal velocity and crash. 
- Patriot Missle defense system misses Scud: 28 dead
  - [Velocity is a real number that can be expressed as a whole number and a decimal 
  (e.g., 3750.2563...miles per hour). Time is kept continuously by the system’s internal clock 
  in tenths of seconds but is expressed as an integer or whole number (e.g., 32,33, 34...). 
  The longer the system has been running, the larger the number representing time. To predict 
  where the Scud will next appear, both time and velocity must be expressed as real numbers. 
  Because of the way the Patriot computer performs its calculations and the fact that its 
  registers are only 24 bits long, the conversion of time from an integer to a real number 
  cannot be any more precise than 24 bits. This conversion results in a loss of precision 
  causing a less accurate time calculation. The effect of this inaccuracy on the range gate’s 
  calculation is directly proportional to the target’s velocity and the length of time 
  the system has been running. Consequently, performing the conversion after the Patriot has 
  been running continuously for extended periods causes the range gate to shift away from 
  the center of the target, making it less likely that the target, in this case a Scud, 
  will be successfully intercepted.](https://www.gao.gov/assets/220/215614.pdf)

## 35. IEEE Foating point representation
~~~{dropdown}

- Numerical form: (-1)<sup>s</sup>M2<sup>E</sup>
  - Sign bit `s` determins whether the number is negative or positive. 
  - Significantd `M` normalizes a fractional value in range [1.0, 2.0).
  - Exponent `E` weights value by power of two. 
- Encoding
  - Most significant bit is sign bit `s`. 
  - `exp` field encodes `E` (but is not equal to `E`)
  - `frac` field encodes `M` (but is not equalt to `M`)

## 36. Three "kinds" of floating point numbers
~~~{dropdown}

- Depends on the `exp` field (`E`).
- Denormalized: `exp` contains all 0s.
- Special: `exp` contains all 1s.
- Normalized: `exp` contains a mix of 0s and 1s. 

~~~

## 37. Normalized floating point numbers
~~~{dropdown}

- When: exp != 000…0 and exp != 111…1
- Exponent coded as a biased value: E  =  exp – Bias
  - exp: unsigned value of `exp` field 
  - Bias = 2<sup>k-1</sup- 1, where `k` is number of exponent bits
    - Single precision: 127 (exp: 1…254, E: -126…127)
    - Double precision: 1023 (exp: 1…2046, E: -1022…1023)
- Significand coded with implied leading 1: M  =  1.xxx…x<sub>2</sub>
  - xxx…x: bits of `frac` field
  - Minimum when frac=000…0 (M = 1.0)
  - Maximum when frac=111…1 (M = 2.0 – ε)
  - Get extra leading bit for "free" (hence the range: `[1.0, 2.0)`)

~~~

## 38. Example: normalized floating point numbers

- Significand:
  - M = 1.1101101101101<sub>2</sub>
  - `frac` = 11011011011010000000000<sub>2</sub>
- Exponent:
  - E = 13
  - Bias = 127
  - `exp` = 140 = 10001100<sub>2</sub>
 - Result: `0`|`10001100`|`11011011011010000000000`

- Exponent value: E = 1 – Bias
 - Significand coded with implied leading 0: M = 0.xxx…x<sub>2</sub>
   - xxx…x: bits of frac
- Cases

  - exp = 000…0, frac ≠ 000…0
    - Numbers closest to 0.0
    - Equispaced

~~~

## 41. Special cases
~~~{dropdown}

- Condition: exp = 111...1 
- Case: exp = 111…1, frac = 000…0
  - Represents value infinity
  - Operation that overflows
  - Both positive and negative
- Case: exp = 111…1, frac != 000…0
  - Not-a-Number (NaN)
  - Represents case when no numeric value can be determined

## 42. Floating operations: basic idea
~~~{dropdown}

- Compute exact result. 
- Make it fit into desired precision. 
  - Possible overflow if exponent too large
  - Possible round to fit into `frac`

- Rounding modes

|                        | 1.40 | 1.60 | 1.50 | 2.50 | -1.50 |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ----- |
| Towards zero           | 1    | 1    | 1    | 2    | -1    |
| Round down             | 1    | 1    | 1    | 2    | -2    |
| Round up               | 2    | 1    | 1    | 3    | -1    |
| Nearest even (default) | 1    | 2    | 2    | 2    | -2    |

- Nearest even
  - Hard to get any other mode without dropping into assembly. 
  - C99 has support for rounding mode management
- All others are statistically based
  - Sum of set of positive numbers will consistently be over- or under-estimated.

## 47. Floating point in C
~~~{dropdown}

- C guarantees two levels
  - `float`: single precision
  - `double`: double precision
- Conversion/casting
  - Casting between int, float, and double changes bit representation
  - double/float to int
    - Truncates fractional part
    - Like rounding toward zero
    - Not defined when out of range or NaN: Generally sets to TMin
  - int to double
    - Exact conversion, as long as int has ≤ 53 bit word size
  - int to float
    - Will round according to rounding mode
