# MPI: point-to-point, data types, and communicators



## 1. Addresses in MPI
```{dropdown}
Data messages (objects) being sent/received (passed around) in MPI 
are referred to by their addresses:
- Memory location to read from to send
- Memory location to write to after receiving.
```


## 2. Parallel workflow
```{dropdown}
Individual processes rely on communication (message passing) to enforce workflow
- Point-to-point communication: `MPI_Send`, `MPI_Recv`
- Collective communication: `MPI_Broadcast`, `MPI_Scatter`, 
`MPI_Gather`, `MPI_Reduce`, `MPI_Barrier`.
```


## 3. Point-to-point: MPI_Send and MPI_Recv
```{dropdown}
- `int MPI_Send(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int dest, int tag,     MPI_Comm comm)`
  - `*buf`: pointer to the address containing the data elements to be sent. 
  - `count`: how many data elements will be sent.
  - `MPI_Datatype`: `MPI_BYTE`, `MPI_PACKED`, `MPI_CHAR`, `MPI_SHORT`, `MPI_INT`, 
  `MPI_LONG`, `MPI_FLOAT`, `MPI_DOUBLE`, `MPI_LONG_DOUBLE`, `MPI_UNSIGNED_CHAR`, 
  and other user-defined types.
  - `dest`: rank of the process these data elements are sent to.
  - `tag`: an integer identify the message. Programmer is responsible for managing tag.
  - `comm`: communicator (typically just used MPI_COMM_WORLD)
- `int MPI_Recv(void *buf, int count, MPI_Datatype datatype, int source, int tag, MPI_Comm comm, MPI_Status *status)`
  - `*buf`: pointer to the address containing the data elements to be written to. 
  - `count`: how many data elements will be received.
  - `MPI_Datatype`: `MPI_BYTE`, `MPI_PACKED`, `MPI_CHAR`, `MPI_SHORT`, `MPI_INT`, 
  `MPI_LONG`, `MPI_FLOAT`, `MPI_DOUBLE`, `MPI_LONG_DOUBLE`, `MPI_UNSIGNED_CHAR`, 
  and other user-defined types.
  - `dest`: rank of the process from which the data elements to be received.
  - `tag`: an integer identify the message. Programmer is responsible for managing tag.
  - `comm`: communicator (typically just used MPI_COMM_WORLD)
  - `*status`: pointer to an address containing a special `MPI_Status` struct that 
  carries additional information about the send/receive process. 
```


## 4. Hands-on: send_recv.c
```{dropdown}
- We want to write a program called send_recv.c that allows two processes to 
exchange their ranks: 
  - Process 0 receives 1 from process 1.
  - Process 1 receives 0 from process 0. 
- Inside `intro-mpi`, create a file named `send_recv.c` with the following
contents

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=send_recv.c"></script>

- Compile and run `send_recv.c`:

~~~
$ mpicc -o send_recv send_recv.c
$ mpirun -np 2 ./send_recv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Did we get what we want? Why?

- Correction: separate sending and receiving buffers. 

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=send_recv_fixed.c"></script>
```


## 5. Hands-on: p2p communication at scale
```{dropdown}
- Rely on rank and size and math.  
- We want to shift the data elements with only message passing among 
adjacent processes. 
- Inside `intro-mpi`, create a file named `multi_send_recv.c` with the following
contents

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=multi_send_recv.c"></script>

- Compile and run `multi_send_recv.c`:

~~~
$ mpicc -o multi_send_recv multi_send_recv.c
$ mpirun -np 4 ./multi_send_recv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- Did we get what we want? Why?

<img src="../assets/figure/08-point-to-point/02.png" alt="compile and run multi_send_recv.c" style="height:350px">
```


## 6. Hands-on: blocking risk
```{dropdown}
- `MPI_Recv` is a blocking call.  
- Meaning the process will stop until it receives the message. 
  - What if the message never arrives?
- Inside `intro-mpi`, create a file named `deadlock_send_recv.c` with the following
contents

<script src="https://gist.github.com/linhbngo/05955842d2a7ce40c9723292a2ded118.js?file=deadlock_send_recv.c"></script>

- Compile and run `deadlock_send_recv.c`:

~~~
$ mpicc -o deadlock_send_recv deadlock_send_recv.c
$ mpirun -np 2 ./deadlock_send_recv
~~~
{: .language-bash}

- What happens?
- To get out of deadlock, press `Ctrl-C`. 

<img src="../assets/figure/08-point-to-point/03.png" alt="compile and run deadlock_send_recv.c" style="height:150px">

- Correction:
  - Pay attention to send/receive pairs. 
  - The numbers of `MPI_Send` must always equal to the number of `MPI_Recv`. 
  - `MPI_Send` should be called first (preferably).
```
